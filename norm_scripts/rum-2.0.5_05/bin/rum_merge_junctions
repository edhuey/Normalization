=head1 NAME

rum_merge_junctions - Merge junctions_*.rum files together.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rum_merge_junctions [-v] --output OUTPUT INPUTS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Takes n input files and produces 1 output file. Input files must be
tab-delimited and must have the following columns:

=over 4

=item intron

=item strand

=item score

=item known

=item standard_splice_signal

=item signal_not_canonical

=item ambiguous      

=item long_overlap_unique_reads

=item short_overlap_unique_reads

=item long_overlap_nu_reads

=item short_overlap_nu_reads

=back

Reads in all the input files and produces a merged output file, where
there is a record for each intron that appeared in any of the input
files. For rows in the input that have the same intron, the new values
of I<score>, I<long_overlap_unique_reads>,
I<short_overlap_unique_reads>, I<long_overlap_nu_reads>, and
I<short_overlap_nu_reads> are the sum of the corresponding fields for
those records in the input data.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-o>, B<--output>
